# Makefile for engineering/devops/ansible/roles
#
# This Makefile facilites finishing up the development of Ansible
# roles.  It should be placed in the 'roles' directory, where each
# subdirectory contains an Ansible role.
#
# Running make as follows
#
#   make <role name> [<role name>]...
#
# will do the following:
#
#   - Run yamllint on *.yml files found in the role
#   - Run ansible-lint on the role itself
#   - Create a "scaffolding" playbook in PLAYBOOKS_DIR
#
# The scaffolding playbooks get their 'name:' from the roles meta
# 'description:', so make sure all roles have proper 'meta/meta.yml'.
# Note that if you don't want the playbooks created simply create your
# own prior to running 'make' - this Makefile will not overwrite them.
